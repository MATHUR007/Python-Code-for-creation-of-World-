The research paper is the work of former (research) MSc student Marcus Clement at the University of Hertfordshire. It sits in the triangle between established graph theoretical metrics, information theoretical measures such as empowerment and relevant goal information(RGI), and human decision-making. All of this on the example of a street network in Soho. The basis for this world can be found on page 33 of the research paper. It is an undirected graph with seven vertices and seven edges.
